In a Dockerfile, both `ARG` and `ENV` are used to define variables, but they serve distinct purposes related to the build process and runtime environment.

### `ARG` (Build-Time Variables):

- `ARG` defines variables that are available only during the image build process.
- They are primarily used to parameterize the build, allowing for dynamic customization of the image creation. Examples include specifying a base image version or build-time configurations.
- `ARG` values are not persisted in the final Docker image's metadata and are not accessible to the application running inside the container at runtime.
- Values for `ARG` can be passed during the docker build command using the `--build-arg` flag.

### `ENV` (Runtime Environment Variables):

- `ENV` defines environment variables that are set within the container's environment and are available both during the build process and at runtime when the container is running.
- They are intended for configuring the application or services running inside the container, such as database credentials, API keys, or application settings.
- `ENV` values persist in the final Docker image and can be accessed by the application running within the container.
- `ENV` variables can be overridden when starting a container using the `-e` or `--env` flag with `docker run`.

### When to Use Which:

- Use `ARG` for variables that are necessary for the image build process but not required by the application at runtime (e.g., specifying a base image, build-time dependencies).
- Use `ENV` for variables that the application needs to function correctly when the container is running (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, application settings).
